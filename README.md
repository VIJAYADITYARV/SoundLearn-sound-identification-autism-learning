# SoundLearn: Autism-Friendly Sound & Maths Learning Platform 🎧🔢

**SoundLearn** is an interactive, web-based educational application designed specifically for children with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**. The platform addresses the challenge of auditory processing, cognitive development, and basic mathematical understanding by providing a safe, structured, and sensory-friendly environment.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Core Learning Modes (Lab 1)
*   **Exploration Mode**: Stress-free discovery of sounds across categories (Animals, Vehicles, Nature, Household).
*   **Quiz Mode**: Test knowledge by identifying the correct sound from options.
*   **Memory Game**: Flip cards to find matching pairs of sounds and images.
*   **Matching Game**: Drag and drop visual cards to their corresponding sounds.

### 🚀 Lab 2 Extension: Maths Learning Module
*   **New Game Modes**:
    1.  **Counting**: Learn to count objects (1-10) with visual aids.
    2.  **Visual Addition**: Simple summation problems using pictures (e.g., 🍎 + 🍎 = 2).
    3.  **Pattern Recognition**: Identify the next item in a sequence (A-B-A-?).
    4.  **Comparison**: Determine which group has "More" or "Less" items.

### 🔬 Research-Based Enhancements (Lab 3: Evidence-Based Practices)
Based on autism research strategies (Errorless Learning & Token Economies), the following features were implemented:

1.  **Errorless Learning Strategy**:
    *   **Concept**: Minimizes frustration by preventing mistakes during initial learning.
    *   **Implementation**: 
        *   When a new problem appears, **wrong answers are ghosted (blurred & semi-transparent)** and cannot be clicked.
        *   The **correct answer glows** with a pulsating green ring.
        *   This state lasts for **3 seconds**, forcing the child to observe the correct answer first, building a "success-only" neural pathway before independent testing begins.

2.  **Visual Token Economy**:
    *   **Concept**: Uses a visual reward system to sustain motivation.
    *   **Implementation**: A **5-Star Token Board** fills up with every correct answer. This transforms abstract "points" into a concrete visual goal (filling the empty slots).

3.  **Enhanced Interaction & Accessibility**:
    *   **Keyboard Support (String Events)**: 
        *   Children with fine motor difficulties can use keys `1`, `2`, and `3` to select options instead of the mouse.
        *   Visual hints ("Key 1") appear on buttons to guide this interaction.
    *   **Screen Capture (Achievement)**: 
        *   Upon completing the Token Board, a personalized **Certificate of Mastery** is generated.
        *   A "Download Certificate" button uses `html2canvas` to capture the React component and save it as a high-quality PNG image for parents to print or keep.

### 📝 Product Information Page
*   **Comprehensive Details**: A dedicated page showcasing product version, features, and target audience.
*   **Team & Collaboration**: Displays student developer details, course information, and academic/industry collaborators.
*   **Repository Access**: Direct link to the GitHub repository.
