# SoundLearn: Autism-Friendly Sound & Maths Learning Platform 🎧🔢

**SoundLearn** is an interactive, web-based educational application designed specifically for children with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**. The platform addresses the challenge of auditory processing, cognitive development, and basic mathematical understanding by providing a safe, structured, and sensory-friendly environment.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Core Learning Modes (Lab 1)
*   **Exploration Mode**: Stress-free discovery of sounds across categories (Animals, Vehicles, Nature, Household).
*   **Quiz Mode**: Test knowledge by identifying the correct sound from options.
*   **Memory Game**: Flip cards to find matching pairs of sounds and images.
*   **Matching Game**: Drag and drop visual cards to their corresponding sounds.

### 🚀 Lab 2 Extension: Maths Learning Module
*   **New Game Modes**:
    1.  **Counting**: Learn to count objects (1-10) with visual aids.
    2.  **Visual Addition**: Simple summation problems using pictures (e.g., 🍎 + 🍎 = 2).
    3.  **Pattern Recognition**: Identify the next item in a sequence (A-B-A-?).
    4.  **Comparison**: Determine which group has "More" or "Less" items.
*   **Accessibility Features**:
    *   **Text-to-Speech**: Questions are read aloud to assist children with reading difficulties.
    *   **Visual Feedback**: Clear, instant feedback with animations for correct/incorrect answers.
    *   **Streak System**: Gamified "Streak" counter to encourage consistent engagement.

### 📝 Product Information Page
*   **Comprehensive Details**: A dedicated page showcasing product version, features, and target audience.
*   **Team & Collaboration**: Displays student developer details, course information, and academic/industry collaborators.
*   **Repository Access**: Direct link to the GitHub repository.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React.js (v18)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (v3) - Responsive & Accessible Design
*   **Icons**: Lucide React
*   **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) & Class Components (`this.state`)
*   **Routing**: Custom Conditional Rendering for seamless navigation
*   **Persistence**: Browser LocalStorage for progress tracking

## 📸 Concepts Implemented

This project demonstrates mastery of the following React concepts:
1.  **Function Components**: Used for the majority of the UI (Home, Maths Learning, Games).
2.  **Class Components**: Implemented in the complex `CreateSoundCard` and `Footer` modules.
3.  **State Management**: Handling complex game states, progress tracking, streaks, and user settings.
4.  **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions, clicks, and form submissions.
5.  **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamic UI updates based on game state, user customization, and routing.
6.  **Forms**: Controlled inputs with validation and live previews (Custom Card Creator).
7.  **Text-to-Speech API**: Integration for auditory learning support.
